# Haskell ray tracer

Simple ray tracer written in Haskell for fun with Guerric Chupin.

Scenes are described in Haskell and must be compiled and linked to the project.
This way the powerful Haskell syntax (e.g. list comprehension) can be used.

See the 'example_images' directory to see a few possibilities.

Implemented features are: reflection, transparency and refraction, directional
light sources and algorithmic texture shading.
